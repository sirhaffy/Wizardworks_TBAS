# Codetest for Wizardworks
By: `Fredrik Sv√§rd`

## Description
This is a code test from Wizardworks, that I did for fun. To see if I could solve it. More in-depth details can be found here 
[wizardworks codetest](https://github.com/Wizardworks-AB/programmeringsuppgift/tree/master).
I also added a DevOps / GitOps pipeline to the project, as this is what I am interested in working with in the future.

## How to run the project
Details on how to run the project in Swedish can be found in the documentation (Documentation_SE) folder.

# Codetest for Wizardworks
By: `Fredrik Sv√§rd`

## Description
This is a codetest from Wizardworks, that I did for fun. To see if I could solve it. More in depth details could be 
found here [wizardworks codetest](https://github.com/Wizardworks-AB/programmeringsuppgift/tree/master).
I also added a DevOps / GitOps pipeline to the project, as this is what I am interested in working with in the future.

## How to run the project
Details in Swedish on how to run the project could be found in the documentations (Documentation_SE) folder.
